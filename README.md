# Fanclub-Server

This repo is for demo project [Fanclub](https://github.com/BruceWangyq/Fanclub-demo). We use [express.js](https://expressjs.com/) and [thirdweb sdk](https://thirdweb.com/) to create erc1155 NFT collection [Fanclub Membership](https://testnets.opensea.io/collection/fanclub-membership-v2).

We also used [cyberconnect API](https://api.cybertino.io/connect/graphiql) to fetch address data. All the followers address will be added to the NFT whitelist.

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
# then
node index.js
```

Open [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) with your browser to see the results.
